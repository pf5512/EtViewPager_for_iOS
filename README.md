EtViewPager_for_iOS
===================

View pager View Controller (displayes an array of UIViewControllers as horizontally positioned sliding pages, left&lt;-->right)

One way to implement a ViewPager Controller (hope to have time for another one).
You can use this as a starting point to make your custom ViewPager by extending the EtViewPagerDelegate protocol,
and by adding additional functionality - quering the ViewPager for the currently loaded ViewController, the currently
displayed ViewController; being informed when the next ViewController will be presented; restricting the presentation
of next of previous ViewController until some condition is met and many more ...
Or you can use it as is.

For use please see the EtViewPager XCode project that is in the repository.
